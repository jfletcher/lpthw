Functions in Python

functions name small units of code in same way variables name strings or numbers

They take arguments

Allow us to build 'mini-scripts' that do certain things


start with the word def (for define)
named appropriately: numbers, letters, underscores OK - must start with letter

then pass unique argument(s) inside curly brackets - multiple args separated with commas

end first line with a colon

then indent 4 spaces underneath on next lines

end function by dedenting ie: pulling in 4 spaces

run (or 'call', or 'use') a function by typing its name followed by parentheses with optional argument(s).

variables in functions are not always connected to variables elsewhere in the script - global vs. local

passing arguments to functions

done in parentheses

can be variables from outside the function
can be math
can be direct numbers/values
can be a mix of all
